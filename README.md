# professional-portfolio

## Description
- My motivation behind this project was to create an early version of my future portfolio I'll be using for employment.
- I built this project to showcase my acquired skills during my bootcamp experience.
- This project enabled me to my work in a central place that's easily accessible. Github is very accessible but not navigable if you're not familiar. Having a website as a portfolio solves that problem.
- I learned that any limits are self-imposed. With enough research, time and practice, I can produce attractive websites I never thought possible.
